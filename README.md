Days 13-15: Consolidation I
You just learned a lot about Swift in only 12 days, so before we continue it's important you reflect on what you've learned: look for weak spots, re-watch videos, re-take tests, and so on, until you feel comfortable that you have mastered all the Swift language fundamentals covered in days 1-12.

- [ ] Day13 – Swift review, day one
- [ ] Day14 – Swift review, day two
- [ ] Day15 – Swift review, day three

- [ ] Day32 – Milestone: Projects 4-6
 

Days 33-40: Codable, buttons, and GCD
The next three projects we’ll be building projects where you meet some of the most important topics in iOS development: working with data from the internet, and taking advantage of the raw power of iOS devices. Of course, you’ll also be making useful products along the way!

- [ ] Day41 – Milestone: Projects 7-9
 

Days 42-49: A whole new world
The next three projects we’ll be making are markedly different from the previous 9 – you’ll learn about making grids rather than tables, learn how to make high-performance 2D games using SpriteKit, and, at last, learn how to save user data.

Days 60-65: Maps and bugs

- [ ] Day91 – Core Graphics redux
 

Days 92-98: The Final Countdown
